# Not just PX-VW converter
## It's also a generator for Tailwind configs

Used as a regular converter, but with extra added.
* Get a whole list;
* Get a ranged list;
* You may enter a prefix and a postfix;
* ...or just get one value if you don't need anything above;

### How to use ranged feature
Values use comma as a delimiter for values, and dashes as a delimiter for range values.
Examples: 
* `12, 15, 42`
* `42`
* `359-420`
* `42, 420-359, 333` 
* `420-359-110, 333, 12-24`

Enjoy.
